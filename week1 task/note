1.  HIDDEN MEDIA:
**Keeping Your Photos and Videos Private on Your iPhone or iPad**

So, it’s normal to want to keep photos that won’t be exposed if we leave the device with someone else for a few minutes.

For years, users asked Apple to implement a password system in the Photos app, and to some extent, it met that request by allowing users to hide the photos they want.

This means that you can choose which images you don’t want to appear in the open photo library, hiding them in a separate folder.

Learn in this tutorial how to hide photos you don’t want anyone to see on your iPhone.

**How to Hide Photos on iPhone**
#   If you want to hide photos from the iPhone library, you’ll need to do it individually on each photo. Follow these steps:

✱ In iOS 15:
*   Open the Photos app and choose the image you want to hide.
*   Tap the Share button 
*   Tap “Hide“.


**How to Hide Photos on iPhone**
✱ From iOS 16 onwards:
*   Open the Photos app and choose the image you want to hide.
*   Tap the three dots button at the top of the screen.
*   Tap “Hide“.

#   Voilà, your photo is hidden and won’t appear in the Photos Library.


____    But… how are YOU going to find this album if it’s hidden?



*How to Find the Hidden Photos Album*
#   To view the album that you yourself hid, there’s no way around it: you’ll have to do the reverse process and enable the option to show it.

*   Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
*   Tap on the Photos menu.
*   Enable the “Show Hidden Items Album” option.

*How to Put a Password on Photos on iPhone*
Starting with iOS 16, Apple finally implements the possibility of protecting your photos with a password.

This is because access to the Hidden Items folder can only happen with the device’s password or biometric authentication.



2.  TRUE TONE:
**What is the True Tone Flash on the iPhone?**
Have you ever wondered how your iPhone’s flash can capture photos with more natural and uniform lighting? The answer lies in the True Tone flash, an innovative technology present in the latest models of the iPhone.

In this article, we will explore in detail what the True Tone flash is, how it works, and what benefits it offers for your photos. Get ready to discover the secrets behind this functionality!

**True Tone Flash: an ally for your photos**
When we think of a flash, we usually imagine a bright white light that can often result in photos with unnatural skin tones.

However, the True Tone flash goes beyond that. It uses not just one, but two lights: one white and one amber.

This combination of colors allows the flash to adjust the color temperature according to the environment you’re in, resulting in photos with more accurate skin tones and balanced lighting.



3.  SIRI:
**Siri Offline Requests Expanding to More Languages on iOS 17**
Apple is set to introduce an exciting update to its virtual assistant, Siri, with the upcoming release of iOS 17. The highly anticipated feature will expand Siri’s offline capabilities to include a wider range of languages, providing users around the world with greater convenience and functionality.

Until now, the offline functionality of Siri was limited to a handful of languages, only available in select countries.

However, with the forthcoming iOS 17 update, users who prefer using Siri in their native language will also be able to take advantage of this feature, including those who communicate in Portuguese, Italian and Arabic.

**What is Siri offline?**
The Siri offline feature allows the virtual assistant to perform certain tasks and execute commands without relying on an internet connection.

Users can seamlessly create alarms, control music playback, adjust system settings, and launch applications, even when offline.


It is important to note that while Siri can operate without internet connectivity, features that require real-time information, such as weather forecasts or up-to-date traffic details, still rely on an internet connection to function accurately.
